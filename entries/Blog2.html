    Introduction
</h1>
<p>
    I wanted to work on something using rust to mostly learn more about Rust because of peer pressure. I feel like most of the code was a lot of math, and because
    rust does not have the support for math libraries like python does, it was pretty hard. <br /> <br /> If I had numpy, most of the code wouldn't have to be written. (But I wouldn't learn about Rust either so I guess everything has a silver lining)

<h1>
    My Approach
</h1>
<p>
    I am not a physicist. I might be wrong on the assumptions I make. <br /> <br /> 
    But, from what I can understand, a qubit from a software perspective is a more complex bit and quantum registers can just be represented as a matrix. <br /> <br />
    So at its core, to simulate the actions of a quantum computer from a classical computer, all that it likely required is to use linear algebra to manipulate the Matrices properly


</p>
</section>
<section id="Design">
<h1>
    Design Choices
</h1>
<p>
    The basic design of the code is this :
    <ul>
        <li> Qubit : a vector of 2 elements</li>
        <li> Quantum Gate : a matrix of the gate it represents</li>
        <li> Quantum Circuits : can hold a vector of quantum gates</li>
        <li> Quantum Register : a vector of Complex float 32's</li>
    </ul>
</p>
</section>
<section id="Issues">
<h1>
    Issues
</h1>
<p>
    First of all, I guarantee that the most of the code I wrote for my linear algebra is likely ineffcient. To be fair I didn't write this program for performance. That should be fixed, <i>I'll probably never come back to it.</i>
</p>
<section id="Issues-1">
<h1>
    Issue #1
</h1>
<p>
    I first had to figure out how to implement a quantum register. Should I do it as a vector of Qubits, or as a Vector of floats? <br /> <br />
    This one I had to choose a vector of floats because to get the vector, you eventually have to get the kronecker product and the conversion to a kronecker product can't be reversed.
</p>
<p>
    From a OOP perspective, it would have been better to try to use a vector of qubits but, to implement the changes of a quantum gate on the register would require the kronecker product
    and this conversion cannot be undone.
</p>

<section id="Issues-2">
<h1>
    Issue #2
</h1>
<p>
    I guess this is more of a TODO, but I have implemented the tools I would need to implement Shor's Algorithm, but I haven't actually implemented the code at all. At this point
    the code is mostly a matrix multiplcation library with a few tweaks for quantum computing simulation.

<h1>
    Why did I write this blog post?
</h1>
<p>
    If I haven't implemented an algorithm, why would I write this Blog post?
</p>
<p>
    One, I would like some help if possible. <a href="https://github.com/kakaname/quantum_sim" target="_blank">Here's the git repository</a>
</p>
<p>
    Two, I feel like writing this blog post will make me work through this final hump.
</p>
<p>
    That is all for this month. Goodbye.
